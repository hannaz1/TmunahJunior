      <h1 id="feature-heading">Jamie Geller, Kosher Media Personality</h1>
    </div>

      <p id="make-block">Jamie Geller is one of my favorite kosher food personalities. Anyone interested in kosher recipes and stylish food presentation has heard of Jamie. As we are in the month of Tishrei, filled with meals of every different type, who better to profile than the well-known food writer, and chef?</p>
      <p>Jamie made Aliyah from Monsey six years ago to Ramat Beit Shemesh, where she lives with her husband, Nachum, and their six children, three boys and three girls ranging in age from 3 to 13.</p>
      <p>Jamie is the author of several cookbooks, and is the founder of Kosher Network International. This successful career had humble beginnings. Jamie decided she wanted to stay home when her oldest daughter was born, and was looking for something creative that she could do. Nachum encouraged Jamie to write a cookbook, because, surprise! Jamie was the bride who knew nothing about cooking. In fact, she was so worried about her lack of skills as a homemaker that she davened under her chuppah that Hashem should help her learn quickly.</p>
      <p>During those first years of her marriage, she was a terrible cook, and made mistake after mistake in the kitchen, her dishes coming out either raw or burnt. However, she loved hosting, and slowly but surely improved her skills until she got so good, she was able to put her recipes into a book.</p>
      <p>This cookbook was titled Quick and Kosher Recipes from the Bride Who Knew Nothing, and it was filled with humorous stories about the mistakes Jamie made in her path to becoming a balabusta. These stories included the time she tried to emulate her grandmother and include lots of vegetables in her soup, but neglected to slice up the vegetables, and every person she served had a whole carrot and an entire celery stalk sticking out of their bowl. Then there was the time she placed her dirty dishes from the Shabbos meals in the oven, hearing that it was a common practice to store them there until after Shabbos when they can be washed. Jamie, however, forgot that the dishes were in the oven, and when she turned on the oven Sunday morning, all the plastic parts of the utensils melted onto her good china dishes. The cookbook also mentions her attempt to bake a snowman cake for her husband, after he recalled the cake his grandmother always made him for him. She constructed the cake with one big ball, one medium ball and one small ball, just like a snowman. Her then-small children decorated the cake with white frosting and buttons for the eyes, candies for the mouth etc. When Nachum gamely tried to cut the cake, everything fell apart. Later, Nachum confided that his grandmother owned a snowman cake mold, and she simply poured the batter into the mold to make it into a shape of a snowman.</p>
      <p>But all these learning experiences turned her cookbook into something much more than a list of recipes. The cookbook became a memoir and an introduction to the kosher lifestyle, chronicling Jamie’s stories of becoming a frum wife and a mother. She expanded her cookbook career into regular articles in the local Jewish papers, live cooking presentations and slowly turned the business into Kosher Network International, a Media, Marketing and Merchandising Company. As Jamie describes it, “We present the kosher Jewish lifestyle through marketing, live events, presentations, and of course, the popular JamieGeller.com website. We meet people wherever they are online or in person, and introduce this lifestyle to people who aren’t familiar with Judaism, but maybe know about latkes on Chanukah or matza brie on Pesach. Food is an easy way to connect. “ JamieGeller.com, Jamie’s signature website, is filled with over 10,000 recipes, menus, videos and other delicious content.</p>
